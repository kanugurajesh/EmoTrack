# EmoTrack

EmoTrack is an app designed to track depression and provide remedies to patients. 🌟 Depression often begins with subtle symptoms and gradually intensifies. Many people may not even realize they're experiencing it until it's severe, potentially leading to serious consequences, including suicide. 😔

However, depression has a straightforward solution: early treatment. If individuals can identify depression in its early stages and seek proper care, it can be easily prevented. 🛡️ Unfortunately, many can't afford psychologists, don't have access to them, or hesitate to seek help without confirmation or proof. 💸🚫

That's why I built EmoTrack. This app helps users take a standard PHQ-9 test to understand their mental condition. 📋 It also features a Gemini bot for asking questions, making it easier for people to get the support they need. 🤖💬
