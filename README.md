# EmoTrack

Emotrack is an application to track depression and provide remedies to the patient. Depression generally starts as a minute syndrome and slowly grows many people cannot even figure out that they have depression which if not taken proper precautions can lead to serious consequences and even suicides. But depression has a simple solution that is early treatment if people can figure out depression in it's early stage and take proper treatment it can be prevented easily. But many people cannot afford psycologists or they are not accessible or cannot go to them without confirming or having a proof. So I have built this application which helps users to take a standard phq-9 test and understand their mental condition it also has a gemini bot to ask questions.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
